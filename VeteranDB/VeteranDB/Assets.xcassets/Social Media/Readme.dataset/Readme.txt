How to use
----------------------------------------------------------
1. Unpack the downloaded archive.
2. In the SF symbols app, create a new custom collection.
3. Drop the icons from the Social Media folder into this collection.

That's it! You can start using social media icons the same way you work with other SF symbols.

Note that in some cases, Interface Builder might ignore the scale of custom SF symbols. In such a case, you should handle the scale change programmatically.
